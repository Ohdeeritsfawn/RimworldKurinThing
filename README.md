Disclaimer: I cannot garantee compatability with your game, if it doesnt work or throws errors its likely conflicting with something
In some cases I cannot garantee simple things like a nonhostile empire without overwriting any potential dependancies.  If its an issue I could always upload the files to correct certain issues.
Lastly credit to where the original authors deserve Im just putting this up here to give players an option to expand/make their kurins vanilla friendly.
##
Side note: I have started quite a few things in terms of balance I never got around to finishing or tweaking for the current release.
Certain projects range from refugee factions/mixed kurin for the world event, slaves, space pirate, and ancient kurins to naturally intergate into the current world.  Some with more bizzare interactions than others (like opening a cyrosleep chamber and theres a kurin in full space marine tier armor).

Secondly: The focus is always vanilla.  Tweaks and balances here are to make the game more enjoyable for people like me who wanna experiance tribal naked brutality or even just a regular start.  I havent played in a while so I havent been able to confirm if recruited kurins arent over powered as well.  So use with caution for now.


### FactionsDef
>Factions_HostileKurin.xml
```
Adds a permanent new faction based on the original hostile one.  This one can never be friendly and exist for recruitment and combat purposes.  2 factions also increase the odds of being attacked by kurins and in turn recruiting them/capturing.
```
>Factions_KurinTribalAddon.xml
```
Core files for the tribal faction. Its based around the vanillia tribal though due to not having any true tribal assests in the SFW version of kurin they start out with random clothings.  Sorry if thats immersion breaking.
